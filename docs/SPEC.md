#### Term Project - CMPT 399: Code Refactoring 
#### Deadline: Dec 1st

#### Learning Objectives

1. Learning how to understand other people’s code and its design.
2. Learning how to refactor legacy code to follow recent best practices in
   Java programming.
3. Learning how to identify bad smells and perform the appropriate
   refactorings (including big refactorings, if necessary) to improve the
   quality of code.

#### Description

* It’s highly recommended, although not required, to do this term project in
  pairs. 
* Play the Monopoly application to see how the game works.
* Analyze and understand the software design.
* Identify the bad smells and refactor the code to remove the smells (if
  necessary, write additional unit tests before you perform any
  refactorings).
* Remember to include justifications of your refactorings.

#### Deliverables

1. Prepare a 15-minute presentation to discuss your understanding of the
   monopoly software design (Nov 1st – weight 3%).
2. Prepare a 15-minute presentation to report your progress (Nov 22nd – 3%
   participation).
3. Prepare a 30-minute presentation to provide a summary of your refactorings
   and discuss one or two significant refactorings in detail (Dec 1st – weight
   4%).
4. Submit your refactored code to Blackboard (Dec 1st – weight 25%).
  1. The evaluation criteria will focus mainly on how clean the refactored
     code and your justifications (20%). Pay attention to details and consider
     best practices in Java programming.
  2. User interface improvements (5%).
  3. Individual contributions and peer reviews will be considered.
